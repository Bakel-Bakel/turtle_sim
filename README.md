# üê¢ Turtlesim "Catch Them All" Project

Welcome to the **Turtlesim Project** repository! The task I achieved is to catch a moving turtle within the simulation by controlling the robot with ROS 2 nodes and messages.

## üéØ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and implement a ROS 2 system where the robot will autonomously move to catch the turtle within the **Turtlesim** environment. This project will help you learn the practical applications of core ROS 2 concepts and improve your ability to design and implement solutions.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Core Concepts Covered

This project covers several essential ROS 2 concepts, including:

- **ROS 2 Nodes:** Created ROS 2 nodes to handle various tasks such as controlling movement, detecting turtle position, and communication.
- **ROS 2 Topics:** Used topics for asynchronous communication between nodes (e.g., robot control, turtle detection).
- **ROS 2 Services:** Implemented synchronous communication for requests such as stopping or resetting the robot.
- **ROS 2 Custom Messages:** Designed custom messages to exchange complex data, such as robot position and movement status.
- **ROS 2 Parameters:** Configured node behavior at runtime using parameters.
- **ROS 2 Launch Files:** Wrote launch files to start the entire application with a single command.
